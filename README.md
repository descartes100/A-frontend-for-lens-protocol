## 📚 Getting Started

## ⚙️ Customization

This starter kit has been setup to work on Polygon Mainnet. You can customize it to work on any other network by editing the `_app.js` file.

You can either grab a free RPC for any network of your choice from [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/protocol/) or use any other RPC provider of your choice. More on that [here](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/installation).
